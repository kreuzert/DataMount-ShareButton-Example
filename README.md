This repository demonstrates how to use the Data Mount features provided by [Jupyter4NFDI](https://nfdi-jupyter.de).

Click the badge above to launch a JupyterLab environment on Jupyter4NFDI. You'll see example folders from an AWS S3 bucket and a B2DROP account already mounted.

This setup showcases how to mount external storage using:
- AWS S3
- B2DROP
- Generic S3
- Generic WebDAV

By combining these mounted data sources with code from this GitHub repository, you can work seamlessly across multiple storage platforms.
